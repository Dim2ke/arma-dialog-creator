### About
Arma Dialog Creator is a tool for creating dialogs for Arma 3. The tool was designed from the beginning to be completely independent from header files (*.h, *.hpp, *.hh), which is how Arma's engine interprets how to create the dialogs. All editing is done with specialized editors such as a color picker and Font chooser.

### Key Features
* Required, optional, and [event handler properties](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/User_Interface_Event_Handlers) listed for all Arma 3 controls.
* Preview window (shows roughly what the dialog would look like in Arma 3)
* Macros so that values don't have to be copied and pasted
* Custom control creation
* SafeZone and Absolute coordinate positioning support ([more info here](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/SafeZone)).
* Preview of Controls that have a .paa image file (must have Arma 3 Tools installed).
