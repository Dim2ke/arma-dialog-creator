ADDED:
    none
CHANGED:
    editing class name of control in tree view will now automatically focus to text field and select all text
FIXED:
    issue that when the hover style (the one for adding into empty folders in editable tree view) was removed, the item couldn't be visibly selected again.
        Turns out the style classes were cleared so I made sure to only remove the hover style instead of clearing the style classes.
