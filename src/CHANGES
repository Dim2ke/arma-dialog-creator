ADDED:
    none
CHANGED:
    removed ViewPortComponent class since everything will be a safeZone value anyways
    removed viewport snapping for same reason above ^
    instead of having ControlProperty value be a String[], just made it be a SerializableValue. This makes more sense honestly
FIXED:
    none
