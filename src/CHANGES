ADDED:
    requesting focus for ValueEditor's editor nodes
CHANGED:
    the override InputField for ValueEditor's to a normal StringChecker since it will be impossible to tell if a quote needs to be cancelled or not
    when Macro key, value, or type isn't set, won't close popup and will make a beep while requestingFocus to the editor missing a value
FIXED:
    none
