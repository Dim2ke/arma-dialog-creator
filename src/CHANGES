ADDED:
    none
CHANGED:
    made the error popup behave better for InputField (autohide and show whenever mouse enters text field)
FIXED:
    hopefully the last update to InputField. I'm getting tired of changing the implementation
    bug where ExpressionInterpreter was returning Exceptions with no message
