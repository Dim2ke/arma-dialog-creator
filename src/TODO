instead of having tabs, have a window of the data that has an update linker to the designer
select many things in tree view and drag into folder
fix "custom color" null pointer for main menu > colors (possibly put all of them into a separate window?)

for when specifying properties of controls, list the required ones and have a button that says "add optional property" and it lists the optional ones.
    There can also be a button that says "add custom property" and it will prompt to fill out the name, type, and value(s)

for extend classes in controls, check if x and y and things were inherited. do not cache the old values. possible have the renderer have a listener on the control properties for x and y
    think about how these data structures are going to be created from description.ext and how they will be saved. this could be an issue

check access property for controls and see if properties can be inherited and such https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Dialog_Control#Dialogs
