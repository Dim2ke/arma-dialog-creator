FEATURES:
-----------------------------------
>for when specifying properties of controls, list the required ones and have a button that says "add optional property" and it lists the optional ones.
    There can also be a button that says "add custom property" and it will prompt to fill out the name, type, and value(s)
>for extend classes in controls, check if x and y and things were inherited. do not cache the old values. possible have the renderer have a listener on the control properties for x and y
    think about how these data structures are going to be created from description.ext and how they will be saved. this could be an issue
>check access property for controls and see if properties can be inherited and such https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Dialog_Control#Dialogs
>have a color theme maker so that you don't need to constantly have to set colors to a macro. Maybe even have a big default archive for all attributes? Maybe just place them inside the lookup thingy?
>go back through the lookup table and remove redundant entries after you figure out the requirements and options for controls
>for preview, have a control state toggler. Also, for action on buttons, have popup window show with action text.
>add check to see if safeZone should be applied to control(s). This is checked by seeing if x,y,w,h properties are < 0 or > 1
>for new control, it isn't proper to say "Required" since the new control can allow for partial implementation
>have help button implementation for all popups

BUGS:
-----------------------------------
>select many things in tree view and drag into folder
>have check box for "is background control" in control properties popup
>ARMA 3 TOOLS LOCATION WILL NEVER SAVE AND LOAD CORRECTLY AFTER CLOSING THE APPLICATION.
>!!!!!!!!!!!!fix adding controls to tree view resulting in wrong render order or an exception
>the default value for a Font macro is wrong in control properties editor (switching from default editor to macro editor)
