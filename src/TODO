FEATURES:
-----------------------------------
>for when specifying properties of controls, list the required ones and have a button that says "add optional property" and it lists the optional ones.
    There can also be a button that says "add custom property" and it will prompt to fill out the name, type, and value(s)
>for extend classes in controls, check if x and y and things were inherited. do not cache the old values. possible have the renderer have a listener on the control properties for x and y
    think about how these data structures are going to be created from description.ext and how they will be saved. this could be an issue
>check access property for controls and see if properties can be inherited and such https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Dialog_Control#Dialogs
>have a color theme maker so that you don't need to constantly have to set colors to a macro. Maybe even have a big default archive for all attributes? Maybe just place them inside the lookup thingy?
>go back through the lookup table and remove redundant entries after you figure out the requirements and options for controls
>for preview, have a control state toggler. Also, for action on buttons, have popup window show with action text.
