FEATURES:
-----------------------------------
>for when specifying properties of controls, list the required ones and have a button that says "add optional property" and it lists the optional ones.
    There can also be a button that says "add custom property" and it will prompt to fill out the name, type, and value(s)
>for extend classes in controls, check if x and y and things were inherited. do not cache the old values. possible have the renderer have a listener on the control properties for x and y
    think about how these data structures are going to be created from description.ext and how they will be saved. this could be an issue
>check access property for controls and see if properties can be inherited and such https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Dialog_Control#Dialogs
>have a color theme maker so that you don't need to constantly have to set colors to a macro. Maybe even have a big default archive for all attributes? Maybe just place them inside the lookup thingy?
>go back through the lookup table and remove redundant entries after you figure out the requirements and options for controls
>for preview, have a control state toggler. Also, for action on buttons, have popup window show with action text.
>add check to see if safeZone should be applied to control(s). This is checked by seeing if x,y,w,h properties are < 0 or > 1
>for new control, it isn't proper to say "Required" since the new control can allow for partial implementation
>have help button implementation for all popups

GENERAL:
-----------------------------------
>create documentation for all classes and **well** document it
>when choosing a macro in control property editor, there should be a way to take off the macro (use controlProperty.setToMacro(null))
>for creating a macro, there should be only one Color option, one SQF code string option - this is to prevent confusion. DO NOT delete the property types. There should just be a behind-the-scenes check
>creating macro string doesn't display on control
>instead of passing around resolution and Env everywhere, there should just be one class that has all that information
>Arma 3 won't allow .png images. All images must be .paa, or .jpg. When we do an export, convert all .png to .paa
    it would be convenient to store the original url to the converted.paa so that the .png won't need to be re-converted

>don't create a new project folder upon every application launch


BUGS:
-----------------------------------
>ControlPropertiesEditorPane ARRAY editor is broken (not implemented)
>select many things in tree view and drag into folder
>have check box for "is background control" in control properties popup
>!!!!!!!!!!!!fix adding controls to tree view resulting in wrong render order or an exception
