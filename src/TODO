Features:
-----------------------------------
>for when specifying properties of controls, list the required ones and have a button that says "add optional property" and it lists the optional ones.
    There can also be a button that says "add custom property" and it will prompt to fill out the name, type, and value(s)
>for extend classes in controls, check if x and y and things were inherited. do not cache the old values. possible have the renderer have a listener on the control properties for x and y
    think about how these data structures are going to be created from description.ext and how they will be saved. this could be an issue
>check access property for controls and see if properties can be inherited and such https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Dialog_Control#Dialogs
>have a color theme maker so that you don't need to constantly have to set colors to a macro. Maybe even have a big default archive for all attributes? Maybe just place them inside the lookup thingy?
>go back through the lookup table and remove redundant entries after you figure out the requirements and options for controls
>for preview, have a control state toggler. Also, for action on buttons, have popup window show with action text.
>add check to see if safeZone should be applied to control(s). This is checked by seeing if x,y,w,h properties are < 0 or > 1
>for new control, it isn't proper to say "Required" since the new control can allow for partial implementation
>have help button implementation for all popups

General:
-----------------------------------
>create documentation for all java classes and **well** document it
>when choosing a macro in control property editor, there should be a way to take off the macro (use controlProperty.setToMacro(null))
>for creating a macro, there should be only one Color option, one SQF code string option - this is to prevent confusion. DO NOT delete the property types. There should just be a behind-the-scenes check
>Arma 3 won't allow .png images. All images must be .paa, or .jpg. When we do an export, convert all .png to .paa
    it would be convenient to store the original url to the converted.paa so that the .png won't need to be re-converted

>preview's resolution should be independent from the editor.
>for extending control, make sure that you implement the xml loading feature to set extended control as well
>instead of converting the .paa and saving it in the project folder, store it in a universal folder where the image is documented on where it was converted from
    this way, the image doesn't get converted more than one per project and you won't need to create the project folder in order to save the .paa
>in project folder, store links to converted .paa images in resources tag or something.


>for ControlClass.getInheritedProperties(), we should detect if they are explicitly redefined in a class, or just inherited. There should probably be two methods
>for exporting display, write enableSimulation and other properties (rename ControlProperty class to ControlClassProperty?)

>for display properties, should be able to set them somewhere. Also, in export dialog, a way to apply changes to display properties
    -also, we need to save display's class name and make sure that is put inside the export dialog

Bugs:
-----------------------------------
>ControlPropertiesEditorPane ARRAY editor is broken (not implemented)
>select many things in tree view and drag into folder
>moving control group in display throws exception
>square scaling: doesn't scale up and back down with same snap amount
>hiding controls when control group is in editor won't hide them until moving mouse into canvas (use the "Show" button above the "Controls" tree view)
